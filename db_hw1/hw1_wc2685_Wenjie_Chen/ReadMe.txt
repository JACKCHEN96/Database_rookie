In this assignment, I complete the following things:

1. Understand the databases
Complete the implementation (inside src) for three classes: RDBDataTable, CSVDataTable, BaseDataTable.
Test all methods including: {
find_by_template,
find_by_primary_key,
insert, delete_by_template,
delete_by_key,
update_by_template,
update_by_key
}

2. Understand SQL query
Use SQL to compute a real question.
Write a function that reads data from CSV files to produce the same result.

For CSVDataTable, csv is used to load .csv data and the data is stored in memory.
For RDBDataTable, pymysql is used to connect the local DB.
For CSV_test and RDB_test, several test cases have been tested and the result have been listed in two txt files respectively.

Please contact wc2685@columbia.edu, if anything goes wrong with this HW.
